# **Find My Wod - API** 
# Final Capstone Project.
 
This is a solo project at the end of the Microverse Main Technical Curriculum. It's a real-world-like project, built with business specifications to improve and test the achievement of technical and soft skills gained during the program. The technical requirements of this API project are:

1. The database should have at least 2 tables
2. Use Postgres as your database
3. Back-end you will use Ruby on Rails
4. Create a REST API to manage database resources
 
## **Built With**
 
- Ruby on Rails
- JWT
- Heroku
